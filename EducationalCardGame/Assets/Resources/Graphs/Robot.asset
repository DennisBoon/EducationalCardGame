    DilemmaText: After the development of combat robot technology had been concluded,
      multiple combat robots were deployed across the border to do border patrol.
      During one of the patrols an accident occured when multiple people tried to
      illegally cross the border, one of the robots on patrol killed the people that
      tried to cross. After the accident the robot in question was brought back for
      repairs, in the action history of the robot engineers found evidence that the
      robot had been treated violently which in the programming of the robot calls
      for immediate action in the form of gunfire.

    DilemmaText: After refusing the research of combat robot technology, a group
      of ambitious engineers approached us with an idea. They would like to get access
      to the robot technology because they wan't to create robots that could help
      improve life as we know it. For example by creating autonomous cars, domestic
      work robots, etcetera. They will however need financial support to make this
      happen.

    DilemmaText: The military wants to continue the robot technology research to
      increase the military strength and defenses of the country by for example using
      combat robots for border patrol.
